## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a "Junior" challenge but I felt like I learned so much, especially with JavaScript and working with the DOM.

Some things I learned in the process:
- Fetch JSON data
- Toggle classes on/off
- Rendering HTML elements with JS
- Event listeners
- Working with JSON data
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

For this project, I think I could have done a better job with my CSS organization and refactoring . These are skills I need to continue developing as I do more challenges.

### Useful resources
